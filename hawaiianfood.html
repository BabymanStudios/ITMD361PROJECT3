		<h1>Hawaiian Food History</h1>
		<p>Everyone loves food, and if you're not a fan of dieting, Hawaiian cuisine might be for you! Here's a brief overview of how Hawaiian food has changed over time:</p>
		<section>
			<h2>Precontact Period (300-500 AD)</h2>
			<img src="visualfiles/poii.jpg" alt="Poi">
			<ul>
				<li>Polynesians arrived with few native edible plants available.</li>
				<li>Introduced at least 27 plant species, most notably taro, which became a staple of their diet and used to make the culturally significant poi (pictured above).</li>
				<li>Limited native meat sources (bats and lizards), so pigs, chickens, and dogs were introduced. Pigs were used in sacrifices and celebrations (luaus).</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Postcontact Period</h2>
			<img src="visualfiles/malasadaa.jpg" alt="Malasada">
			<ul>
				<li>James Cook introduced seeds for plants like onions, pumpkins, and melons.</li>
				<li>George Vancouver brought cattle, leading to beef becoming a Hawaiian staple. Paniolos (Mexican cowboys) taught locals ranching.</li>
				<li>Sugar plantations brought economic power to the Big Five plantation owners, who eventually overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy.</li>
				<li>Immigrant workers from China, Japan, Korea, and Portugal brought new foods like rice, barbecue pits, and malasadas (pictured above), gradually replacing traditional ingredients.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Statehood and Modern Era</h2>
			<img src="visualfiles/locomocoo.jpg" alt="Loco Moco">
			<ul>
				<li>After so much influence in the Postcontact period, Hawaiian locals had lost a lot of their food culture.</li>
				<li>In the mid-20th century, 12 chefs compiled 120 recipes representing a blend of Hawaiian and immigrant cuisines.</li>
				<li>Modern Hawaiian dishes like loco moco were born (pictured above), using local ingredients rather than imported plantation crops.</li>
				<li>Today, Hawaiians embrace new foods like Spam, and meat is often prepared teriyaki-style.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Hawaii has become a true cultural melting pot, with locals adding their own twist to traditional ethnic dishes, creating a unique flavor that blends influences from around the world.</p>
